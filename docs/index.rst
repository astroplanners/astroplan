**********************************
Observation Planning (`astroplan`)
**********************************

What is astroplan?
==================

**astroplan** is an open source Python package that helps astronomers plan
observations.

We're just getting started, so for now check out `Astropy`_, `PyEphem`_ or
`Skyfield`_.

**astroplan** is a flexible toolbox for observation planning and scheduling,
and is appropriate for astronomers at all skill levels.
It's also great for observatories preparing long-term or nightly schedules,
since **astroplan** can consider multiple constraints (i.e., airmass, moon,
slew speeds, etc.)

We anticipate that **astroplan** will have the following required dependencies:

* Python 2.7 or 3.3+ (Python 2.6 and 3.2 or earlier are not supported.)
* Numpy
* Astropy
* pytz

with potential optional dependencies including Matplotlib and PyEphem (or Skyfield).

**A first version is expected to roll out in late August 2015.**
